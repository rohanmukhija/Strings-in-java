Strings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. String buffers support mutable strings. Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:

     String str = "abc";
 
is equivalent to:

     char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
     String str = new String(data);
